// Digital Marketplace for Farmers Build a digital platform that connects farmers directly with buyers, retailers, or consumers. The system should allow farmers to list their crops with quantity, price, and location details. Buyers should be able to search for available produce, compare prices, and place orders. The platform should promote transparency, fair pricing, and reduced dependency on middlemen. The objective is to demonstrate how digital tools can empower farmers and improve access to markets.
