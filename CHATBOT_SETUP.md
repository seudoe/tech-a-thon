## Files Added/Modified

### New Files
- `app/api/chatbot/route.ts` - API endpoint for chat functionality
- `components/Chatbot.tsx` - Main chatbot component
- `components/ChatbotButton.tsx` - Floating button component
- `types/speech-recognition.d.ts` - TypeScript declarations for Speech API

### Modified Files
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added ChatbotButton to global layout
- `.env.local` - Added GROQ_API_KEY configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Voice Recognition Not Working
- Ensure you're using HTTPS (required for microphone access)
- Check browser permissions for microphone
- Voice recognition works best in Chrome/Edge

### API Errors
- Verify GROQ_API_KEY is correctly set in .env.local
- Check Groq API quota and billing
- Look at browser console for detailed error messages

### Chat Not Opening
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure all components are properly imported
- Verify the floating button is visible (green circle, bottom-right)

## Customization

### Changing the System Prompt
Edit the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `app/api/chatbot/route.ts` to modify the chatbot's behavior.

### Styling
The chatbot uses Tailwind CSS classes. Modify the components to match your design system.

### Adding More Languages
Update the speech recognition language in `components/Chatbot.tsx`:
```typescript
recognitionInstance.lang = 'hi-IN'; // For Hindi
```

## Security Notes
- The chatbot only responds to agriculture-related questions
- API key is stored server-side and never exposed to the client
- No chat history is permanently stored
- Voice input is processed locally in the browser
