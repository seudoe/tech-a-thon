```

- **3.0+ stars**: Fair (Orange)
- **Below 3.0**: Needs Improvement (Red)
- **No ratings**: "No ratings yet" (Gray)

### Statistics Included:
- **Average Rating**: Rounded to 1 decimal place
- **Total Ratings**: Number of reviews received
- **Rating Distribution**: Count of each star rating (1-5)
- **Total Orders**: All orders (buyer/seller)
- **Completed Orders**: Successfully delivered orders
- **Total Value**: Sum of all order values
- **Success Rate**: (Completed / Total) × 100% (buyers only)
- **Active Products**: Current product listings (farmers only)
